## Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions

### STEP 1: Select UNESCO Learning Objective (10 minutes)

**Facilitator Actions:**

1. **Introduction (3 min)**
   ```
   - Welcome students
   - Brief overview of UNESCO Framework
   - Explain the three progression levels (Acquire, Deepen, Create)
   - Show the five competency areas
   ```

2. **Guided Selection (5 min)**
   ```
   - Display the UNESCO framework matrix (use slide)
   - Walk through 2 example selections with rationale
   - Prompt students to consider:
     * Their teaching context
     * Student needs they've observed
     * Their own developmental goals
   ```

3. **Individual Work (2 min)**
   ```
   - Students independently select their objective
   - Write it down with 2-3 sentence justification
   - Quick check: Raise hand when selected
   ```

**Sample Script:**

> "Let's start by selecting your learning objective. Look at this matrix - you have 15 possible objectives across five competency areas and three levels. For example, if you're new to AI in education, you might choose 'Understand basic AI ethical principles' at the Acquire level. If you're already using AI tools, you might select 'Apply human-centered principles in AI tool selection' at the Deepen level. Take two minutes now to select one objective that resonates with your current teaching context and write it down with a brief justification."

**Common Student Questions:**

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "Can I choose multiple objectives?" | "Focus on ONE for today. You can create additional modules later." |
| "What if I don't understand all the terms?" | "That's okay! Choose based on what resonates with you. We'll explore the concepts as we work." |
| "Should I choose an easy or challenging objective?" | "Choose what's relevant to your context. All levels are equally valid." |
| "Can I change my objective later?" | "Yes, but try to commit now so you can complete the full workflow today." |

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] All students have selected one objective
- [ ] Objectives are written down
- [ ] A few students share their selections (2-3 volunteers)
- [ ] Move on when 80%+ have selected

**Troubleshooting:**

- **Issue:** Students overwhelmed by choices
  - **Solution:** Offer 3-4 pre-selected "recommended" objectives for beginners

- **Issue:** Students all choosing the same objective
  - **Solution:** Encourage diversity, but don't force it. Similar objectives can still yield different modules.

---

### STEP 2: Research with Consensus AI (20 minutes)

**Facilitator Actions:**

1. **Tool Introduction (3 min)**
   ```
   - Demonstrate Consensus AI interface
   - Show how to formulate search queries
   - Model one complete search example
   ```

2. **Live Demonstration (5 min)**
   ```
   - Take a sample objective: "Understand AI ethical principles"
   - Transform to search query: "What are main ethical issues in educational AI?"
   - Show search results
   - Demonstrate how to evaluate papers
   - Show how to extract key information
   ```

3. **Guided Practice (10 min)**
   ```
   - Students search for their own objectives
   - Walk around (physical) or monitor (virtual) for issues
   - Encourage students to try 2-3 different search queries
   - Prompt them to select 5-8 relevant papers
   ```

4. **Wrap-Up (2 min)**
   ```
   - Quick share: "Show of hands - who found at least 5 relevant papers?"
   - Address any major issues
   - Confirm everyone can proceed to next step
   ```

**Sample Script:**

> "Now we're going to research our topic using Consensus AI. This is different from Google - it searches specifically through academic papers and gives you evidence-based summaries. Watch as I demonstrate: I'm starting with a broad query 'AI ethics in education.' Notice how Consensus provides synthesis across multiple papers? Now I can dig deeper with 'bias in educational AI systems.' The key is to start broad, then narrow based on what you find. You have 10 minutes to find 5-8 papers relevant to your objective. Remember to note the key findings, not just collect papers."

**Sample Search Query Transformations:**

| UNESCO Objective | Effective Search Query |
|------------------|------------------------|
| "Understand basic AI ethical principles" | "What are ethical concerns with AI in education?" |
| "Apply human-centered principles in tool selection" | "What makes educational AI tools effective?" |
| "Design AI-enhanced experiences" | "How can AI support personalized learning?" |
| "Integrate AI tools into teaching practice" | "AI tools for formative assessment in classrooms" |
| "Analyze ethical implications of AI" | "What ethical frameworks guide educational AI use?" |

**Monitoring Student Progress:**

Check that students are:
- [ ] Actually searching (not stuck on account creation)
- [ ] Finding relevant papers (not getting irrelevant results)
- [ ] Recording key information (not just bookmarking)
- [ ] Moving beyond first search (iterating queries)
- [ ] Making progress (not perfectionism paralysis)

**Common Student Issues:**

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Too narrow search | "I can't find anything!" | "Start broader - remove specific terms" |
| Too vague search | "I got 10,000 results!" | "Add discipline/context terms (TVET, higher ed)" |
| Perfectionism | Still searching after 15 min | "Select your top 5 now - you can add more later" |
| Off-topic results | Papers not matching objective | "Reformulate query - use more specific terms" |
| Technical issues | Can't access Consensus | Have backup option: Google Scholar with site filter |

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] 80%+ of students have 3-5 relevant papers minimum
- [ ] Students have noted key findings from papers
- [ ] Any major technical issues resolved
- [ ] Ready to move to design phase

**Time Management:**

- If running over: "Everyone pause where you are. If you have 3+ papers, that's enough to proceed."
- If finishing early: "Great! Dig deeper into your top 2-3 papers. What specific data or examples could you use?"

---

### STEP 3: Design Outline with ChatGPT (25 minutes)

**Facilitator Actions:**

1. **Prompt Engineering Mini-Lesson (5 min)**
   ```
   - Explain the mega-prompt concept
   - Demonstrate structure: context, task, constraints, format
   - Show live example of prompt iteration
   - Explain why specificity matters
   ```

2. **Share Template (2 min)**
   ```
   - Provide the mega-prompt template (on slide or shared doc)
   - Walk through each section students need to fill
   - Emphasize customization, not just filling blanks
   ```

3. **Guided Creation (15 min)**
   ```
   - Students work on their prompts
   - Submit to ChatGPT
   - Review initial output
   - Iterate based on quality check
   - Aim for 2-3 iterations minimum
   ```

4. **Quality Check (3 min)**
   ```
   - Share quality criteria checklist
   - Students self-assess their outlines
   - Address common gaps (time estimates, activities, assessments)
   ```

**Sample Script:**

> "Now we're going to design our course outline using ChatGPT. The key to getting good output is giving ChatGPT excellent input - this is called prompt engineering. I'm going to show you a mega-prompt template that includes everything ChatGPT needs to create a quality outline. Notice how it specifies the learning objective, target audience, duration, pedagogical approach, and even includes research findings? Watch as I submit this and see what comes back. [Pause for demo] Good start, but I need to make it more specific to TVET contexts. So I'm going to add: 'Can you add more workplace-authentic examples and hands-on activities?' This is the iterative process - you rarely get perfect output on the first try."

**The Mega-Prompt Template (Display on screen):**

```markdown
I need your help designing a self-paced microcredential learning module. Here are the specifications:

**LEARNING OBJECTIVE:** 
[Your UNESCO objective - be specific]

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
[Who are your learners? Level, context, prior knowledge]

**DURATION:** 
30-45 minutes

**DELIVERY FORMAT:**
Interactive LiaScript presentation for self-paced learning

**RESEARCH FINDINGS:**
[Paste 2-3 key findings from Consensus AI - actual findings, not just citations]

**PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH:**
Adult learning principles with constructivist methods

---

Please create a detailed course outline with:

1. **Module Title** - Engaging and descriptive

2. **Learning Outcomes** (3-4 specific, measurable outcomes using Bloom's taxonomy)

3. **Module Structure** with:
   - Section titles
   - Time allocation per section
   - Content summary
   - Planned activities (varied: video, reading, interactive, reflection)
   - Assessment checkpoints

4. **Assessment Strategy**:
   - 2-3 formative assessment activities
   - 1 summative assessment
   - Clear success criteria

5. **Resource List**:
   - Required readings/videos
   - Supplementary materials
   - Tools/platforms needed

6. **Differentiation Strategies**:
   - Options for different learning paces
   - Extension activities for advanced learners
   - Support scaffolding for struggling learners

Format the outline clearly with sections and subsections. Ensure adult learning principles are evident throughout (relevance, self-direction, experience-based, problem-centered).
```

**Iteration Prompts to Share:**

After initial output, students should ask ChatGPT:

1. "Can you add more specific examples relevant to [their TVET field]?"
2. "How can I make the activities more interactive and hands-on?"
3. "What multimedia elements would enhance engagement for adult learners?"
4. "Can you suggest more varied assessment types beyond quizzes?"
5. "How should I sequence this content for optimal knowledge progression?"

**Quality Checklist (Share with students):**

```markdown
Your outline should have:
- [ ] Clear module title (engaging, descriptive)
- [ ] 3-4 measurable learning outcomes
- [ ] 3-5 main sections with time estimates
- [ ] Mix of content types (not just text)
- [ ] At least 3 interactive elements
- [ ] Formative assessments throughout
- [ ] One summative assessment
- [ ] Realistic time allocations (total = 30-45 min)
- [ ] TVET-specific examples and context
- [ ] Differentiation strategies mentioned
```

**Monitoring Progress:**

Walk around or check screens to see:
- [ ] Students have submitted their prompt
- [ ] ChatGPT has responded with structured outline
- [ ] Students are reading the output critically
- [ ] Students are iterating (not just accepting first output)
- [ ] Outlines are realistic in scope and time

**Common Issues:**

| Issue | How to Identify | Solution |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Outline too ambitious | 60+ min of content listed | "Cut it in half. Pick your most essential 3 sections." |
| Too generic | No TVET-specific content | "Add iteration prompt: 'Make all examples relevant to [field]'" |
| Missing assessments | No quizzes or activities | "Add: 'Include 3 formative checks and 1 final assessment'" |
| Passive learning | All content is reading/watching | "Request: 'Add hands-on activities and reflection prompts'" |
| Poor time estimates | Unrealistic (5 min to learn complex concept) | "Ask ChatGPT to be more realistic about timing" |

**If Students Get Stuck:**

> "Raise your hand if ChatGPT's first output wasn't quite what you needed. That's normal! This is where the 'chat' part comes in. Tell ChatGPT specifically what to change. For example: 'This is too theoretical. Can you add practical, hands-on activities relevant to automotive repair training?'"

**Checkpoint Before Moving On:**

- [ ] All students have a structured outline
- [ ] Outlines include learning outcomes, sections, activities, assessments
- [ ] Time allocations are reasonable
- [ ] Content is relevant to students' objectives
- [ ] Students feel confident to move to build phase

**Time Management:**

- **If ahead of schedule:** "Great! Take 5 extra minutes to refine your outline. Think about what multimedia resources you'll need."
- **If behind schedule:** "We need to move on in 3 minutes. If your outline isn't perfect, that's okay - you'll refine it in the next step."

**Sample Script:**

> "Now we're moving from outline to actual interactive presentation using LiaScript. LiaScript is a markdown-based format that creates beautiful, interactive learning modules. The reason we're using Claude for this step is that Claude has excellent markdown skills and understands LiaScript syntax well. I'm going to show you the prompt to use, then you'll paste your ChatGPT outline into Claude along with this prompt. Claude will transform it into a complete LiaScript file. But remember - this is still collaborative. You'll need to review Claude's output, test it, and refine it."

**The LiaScript Build Prompt (Share with students):**

```markdown
I need you to transform my course outline into a complete LiaScript presentation. Here's what I have:

**MY COURSE OUTLINE:**
[Paste full ChatGPT outline here]

```

**Key Points to Emphasize:**

1. **Claude is helping, not replacing you**
   - Review every section
   - Add your expertise and examples
   - Don't accept generic content

2. **Iteration is expected**
   - First output won't be perfect
   - Ask Claude to refine specific sections
   - Request different approaches if needed

3. **Focus on essentials first**
   - Get the structure right
   - Add basic interactivity
   - Polish later if time permits

**Common Claude Interaction Patterns:**

| Student Need | Follow-up Prompt |
|--------------|------------------|
| More specific examples | "Can you replace the generic examples with specific scenarios from [field]?" |
| Better quiz questions | "Make these quiz questions more application-based and challenging" |
| Add interactivity | "Add more hands-on activities and reflection prompts throughout" |
| Visual improvement | "Enhance the visual design with more custom styling and structure" |
| Simplify | "This is too complex. Simplify the language and structure" |

**Monitoring During Build Phase:**

Check that students are:
- [ ] Successfully getting output from Claude
- [ ] Reviewing the output (not just copying blindly)
- [ ] Asking follow-up questions to refine
- [ ] Making personal additions (examples, context)
- [ ] Testing output in LiveEditor periodically

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

**Issue: "Claude's output is too generic"**
```
Solution Prompt: "This is too generic. Add specific examples relevant to [automotive repair/nursing/welding/etc.] and use realistic workplace scenarios."
```

**Issue: "The quizzes are too easy"**
```
Solution Prompt: "Make these quiz questions more challenging. They should require application and analysis, not just recall. Use realistic scenarios from [field]."
```

**Issue: "Too much text, not enough interaction"**
```
Solution Prompt: "Break up the text-heavy sections. Add interactive elements like:
- Reflection questions with text input
- Scenario-based decision points
- Practice activities
- Visual diagrams
Aim for an interactive element every 5 minutes of content."
```

**Issue: "The structure is confusing"**
```
Solution Prompt: "Reorganize this to have a clearer logical flow:
1. Introduction with hooks
2. Foundation concepts
3. Application/practice
4. Assessment
5. Summary
Each section should have clear boundaries and transitions."
```

**Issue: "Citations are missing or wrong"**
```
Solution Prompt: "Add a proper References section at the end with APA citations for:
[paste your Consensus AI sources]
Also add in-text citations where you reference these sources."
```

**Quick LiaScript Syntax Reference (Share):**

```markdown
# Main Title (appears once at top)
## Section Heading (new slide)
### Subsection (within same slide)

--- (slide break)

!?[Video Title](YouTube URL)   ← embeds video

![Image alt text](image URL)   ← adds image

[( )] Wrong answer             ← multiple choice
[(X)] Correct answer

[[solution text]]              ← text input question

    --{{0}}--                   ← voice narration
Narration text here

<div class="highlight">         ← custom styled box
Content
</div>
```

**Checkpoint at 20-minute mark:**

Ask students to raise hand to indicate progress:
- ✋ "Got complete markdown from Claude" - Most should have this
- ✋ "Tested in LiveEditor and it loads" - Some should have this
- ✋ "Made refinements and additions" - A few might have this

**If Many Students Are Stuck:**

Call a brief pause and do a live demonstration:
1. Show your screen
2. Take a sample outline
3. Submit to Claude with prompt
4. Show the output
5. Paste into LiveEditor
6. Show it working
7. Demonstrate one refinement iteration

**Time Warning at 30 minutes:**

> "You have 5 minutes left in the build phase. Your goal is to have a working LiaScript file that loads in LiveEditor. It doesn't need to be perfect - you'll refine it in the next step. If you're still iterating with Claude, accept what you have now and move to testing."

**Before Moving to Step 5:**

- [ ] All students have markdown file from Claude
- [ ] Most students have tested in LiveEditor

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technical Issues

**Issue: Student can't access Consensus AI**

- **Cause:** Might require institutional email for free tier
- **Solution 1:** Use personal email to create account
- **Solution 2:** Use Google Scholar as alternative
- **Prevention:** Have students create accounts before workshop

**Issue: ChatGPT says "At capacity"**

- **Cause:** High traffic on free tier
- **Solution 1:** Wait 5-10 minutes and retry
- **Solution 2:** Use Claude for outline design instead
- **Solution 3:** Have students work on refinement of previous step meanwhile

**Issue: Claude is slow to respond**

- **Cause:** Complex prompt, network issues, or service load
- **Solution 1:** Break prompt into smaller pieces
- **Solution 2:** Simplify the request
- **Solution 3:** Have students start with basic structure, add details later

**Issue: LiaScript LiveEditor won't load**

- **Cause:** Network restrictions, outdated browser, or service outage
- **Solution 1:** Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Solution 2:** Check if institution firewall blocks the site
- **Solution 3:** Use alternative: https://liascript.github.io/ (main site)
- **Prevention:** Test all platforms from your institution's network beforehand

**Issue: GitHub upload fails**

- **Cause:** File format issue, size limit, or connection problem
- **Solution 1:** Ensure file is .md extension
- **Solution 2:** Check file size (should be small, mostly text)
- **Solution 3:** Copy/paste content into GitHub's web editor instead

### Pedagogical Issues

**Issue: Student's objective is too broad**

- **Symptoms:** Trying to teach "everything about AI ethics"
- **Solution:** "Let's narrow this. Pick ONE aspect of AI ethics - like bias detection or privacy concerns. You can create multiple modules later."

**Issue: Student's objective is too narrow**

- **Symptoms:** "Understand the definition of algorithmic bias"
- **Solution:** "That's too small for a 30-minute module. Can you expand to include examples, impact, and detection strategies?"

**Issue: Outline is all theory, no practice**

- **Symptoms:** Reading and videos only, no hands-on work
- **Solution:** "Adult learners need to DO something. Add:
  - Case study analysis
  - Decision-making scenarios
  - Tool exploration
  - Reflection on own practice"

**Issue: Module is too long**

- **Symptoms:** 90+ minutes of content
- **Solution:** "This is actually 2-3 modules. Pick your most essential 3 sections and save the rest for 'Module 2.'"

**Issue: No connection to TVET context**

- **Symptoms:** Generic examples, no workplace relevance
- **Solution:** "Every example should connect to real TVET work. Replace 'business scenario' with 'welding shop scenario' or 'healthcare clinic scenario.'"

### Process Issues

**Issue: Student is perfectionist and behind**

- **Symptoms:** Still refining Step 2 when others are on Step 4
- **Solution:** "Your goal today is DONE, not PERFECT. Move forward now with what you have. You can refine later."

**Issue: Student rushes and produces low quality**

- **Symptoms:** Finished in half the time, but output is bare minimum
- **Solution:** "Great progress! Now let's refine. [Show specific improvements needed]. Take 10 more minutes to enhance quality."

**Issue: Student is overwhelmed and shutting down**

- **Symptoms:** Not engaging, saying "I can't do this"
- **Solution:** 
  1. Break it down: "Just focus on this one step right now"
  2. Lower stakes: "This is practice. It doesn't have to be perfect"
  3. Provide template: "Start with this example and modify it"
  4. Partner them: "Work with [name] for this part"

**Issue: Technical skills vary widely**

- **Symptoms:** Some students fly ahead while others struggle with basics
- **Solution:**
  1. Create "fast track" for advanced students (extensions)
  2. Pair experienced students with struggling ones
  3. Have "checkpoint helpers" - students who finish early help others
  4. Provide differentiated support materials

### Content Issues

**Issue: AI generates biased or problematic content**

- **Symptoms:** Stereotypical examples, cultural insensitivity, etc.
- **Solution:** Use as teaching moment:
  - "What's problematic about this example?"
  - "How would you revise it?"
  - "This shows why human review is essential"
- **Prevention:** Emphasize critical review in instructions

**Issue: Citations are wrong or missing**

- **Symptoms:** Made-up references, incorrect formatting
- **Solution:** "Always verify citations against your Consensus AI sources. If you didn't read it, don't cite it."

**Issue: Content is too advanced/too simple for audience**

- **Symptoms:** Students report module is not right level
- **Solution:** "Revise with specific audience in mind:
  - Add prerequisites statement
  - Provide scaffolding OR extension activities
  - Adjust examples and language"

### Time Management Issues

**Issue: Running significantly behind schedule**

- **Solutions:**
  1. **Skip breakout activities** - move to large group
  2. **Assign homework** - complete documentation as homework
  3. **Compress Step 5** - test only major components
  4. **Extend session** - if possible, add 15-30 minutes

**Issue: Finishing too early**

- **Solutions:**
  1. **Deep dive refinement** - improve visual design, add more interactivity
  2. **Peer review** - students exchange modules and provide feedback
  3. **Extension activity** - start planning Module 2
  4. **Showcase** - students present their modules to class
