---

## 🔬 STEP 2: Research with Consensus AI

<div class="step-box">

### Your Research Task

**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Tool:** [Consensus AI](https://consensus.app)

**Objective:** Gather 5-8 high-quality academic sources related to your learning objective

</div>

### What is Consensus AI?

<div class="tool-box">

**Consensus AI** is an AI-powered academic search engine that:

- ✅ Searches through 200+ million academic papers
- ✅ Provides evidence-based summaries with citations
- ✅ Identifies consensus and controversy in research
- ✅ Offers free access to abstracts and summaries
- ✅ Helps filter by study type, recency, and quality

**Why use it?** Unlike regular search engines, Consensus prioritizes peer-reviewed research and provides clear synthesis of findings.

</div>

### Step-by-Step Research Process

**1️⃣ Access Consensus AI**

```
Visit: https://consensus.app
Create free account (optional but recommended)
```

**2️⃣ Formulate Search Queries**

Transform your UNESCO objective into searchable questions:

| UNESCO Objective | Effective Search Query |
|------------------|------------------------|
| "Apply human-centered principles in AI tool selection" | "What makes AI tools effective for education?" |
| "Understand basic AI ethical principles" | "What are the main ethical issues in AI for education?" |
| "Design AI-integrated pedagogical approaches" | "How can AI enhance active learning strategies?" |

<div class="warning-box">

**⚠️ Pro Tip:** Start broad, then narrow. Use follow-up questions to dig deeper into specific aspects.

</div>

**3️⃣ Evaluate & Select Sources**

Look for papers that:

- ✅ Are recent (last 5 years preferred)
- ✅ Have clear relevance to TVET/higher education
- ✅ Provide practical insights, not just theory
- ✅ Come from reputable journals or conferences
- ✅ Include diverse perspectives

**4️⃣ Extract Key Information**

For each source, note:

- **Main finding/argument**
- **Key evidence/data**
- **Practical implications**
- **Direct quotes** (with page numbers for later citation)
- **How it relates to your learning objective**

**5️⃣ Document Your Sources**

Create a simple reference table:

| Author(s) | Year | Title | Key Finding | Relevance |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Example | 2024 | Example Title | Main point | How it connects |

### 🎯 Practice Exercise

    [[Enter your UNESCO learning objective here...]]

Now search Consensus AI for: "______________________"

Expected number of relevant papers found: [[5-10]]
