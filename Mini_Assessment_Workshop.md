## 📚 What Makes a Good TVET Assessment?

### 📌 Core Criteria
- Constructive Alignment (Learning Outcome ↔ Assessment ↔ Instruction)
- Validity (Measures what it claims)
- Fairness & Inclusivity
- Practical relevance (e.g., performance or simulation tasks)

> _“Assessments should reflect the tasks learners are likely to encounter in real workplaces.”_  
> — UNESCO Strategy for TVET

### 🌐 Frameworks to Consider:
- **UNESCO TVET Strategy 2022–2029**
- **Sri Lanka Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) NQF**
- **ASEAN Future Skills Vision**

## 🤖 Live Demo: Assessment Design with AI (Instructor Demo)

> We now explore how AI can support you in co-designing different assessment types.

### 🛠️ Prompt Example:
```
Design a 3-question quiz for NQF Level 4 students in electrical engineering on wiring safety. Include:
- 1 multiple-choice question
- 1 short answer task
- 1 practical scenario with rubric
```

### 👇 Output Example (ChatGPT):
- Q1: What is the color code for the earth wire in Sri Lanka?
- Q2: Describe two risks of improper earthing.
- Q3: A student is asked to wire a plug and test it using a multimeter. How would you assess this task?

### ✅ AI-Rubric Prompt:
```
Generate a 3-point rubric to assess a practical wiring task. Focus on safety, accuracy, and tool handling.
```

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Your Turn: AI-Powered Task Design

### 📝 Activity Instructions:

In small groups:

1. Choose a subject area (e.g., IT, construction, green energy)
2. Use the provided **Prompt Template** to generate:

   - 1 Multiple-Choice Question
   - 1 Scenario-Based Task
   - A simple 3-level Rubric

👩‍💻 Use your own browser + ChatGPT or any AI text tool.

### ⏳ Time: 15 minutes

## 🤝 Peer Review & Rubric Check

### Instructions:

- Exchange your assessments with another group
- Use the **rubric generator** or checklist to review:

  - ✅ Is the question valid?
  - ⚖️ Is it fair and inclusive?
  - 🔁 Can it be improved?

Optional rubric prompt:

```
Create a checklist for assessing fairness in TVET test questions.
```

🗣 Discuss results briefly.

## 📣 Showcase: Present & Reflect

Each group shares:

- One example question/task
- How AI helped
- Any limitations or surprises

💬 Open reflection:

- What did you learn?
- How can AI fit into your daily work?
